# Causal Set Theory: Understanding Black Hole Horizon Entropy through the Spacetime Mutual Information (SMI)

This repository contains a series of classes which create causal set simulations, that is, efficient sprinklings in different settings. Additionally, it provides functionality to calculate the SMI for these simulations. The aim of such calculations is to study the SMI as a potential source for black hole "entanglement-like" entropy. 

## Structure

- causal_sets: contains the classes necessary for both the sprinklings and the SMI calculations
- tests: contains unit tests (i.e. short, hard-coded tests which are not random and run fast)
